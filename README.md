### What I learned

I Learned To use EventListener And Manipulate Dom. Was lil bit tricky i couldn't Understand What to do But later I Fount Solution.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
  expandButtons.forEach(function (button) {
    button.addEventListener("click", function () {
      const answer = button.nextElementSibling;
      const icon = button.lastElementChild;

      answer.classList.toggle("hidden");
      icon.src = answer.classList.contains("hidden")
        ? "/assets/images/icon-plus.svg"
        : "/assets/images/icon-minus.svg";
```
